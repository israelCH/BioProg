The model reproduces the same amplitude antiphase calcium oscillations of coupled cells depicted in Figure 5B of the publication. This model was successfully tested on Jarnac and MathSBML. The values of  "h1" and "h2" are not given in the publication, but  the antiphase oscillations are reproduced over a narrow range of values of h1, h2,c1,c2,D and p. The values of D and p are given, while the other values were plugged in, in order to simulate the time profiles shown in the Figure. The time t=0 in the figure may have been fixed after the system was allowed to settle, and hence does not correspond to the t=0 of the simulation.To the extent possible under law, all copyright and related or neighbouring rights to this encoded model have been dedicated to the public domain worldwide.
