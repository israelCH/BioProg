Background To examine the expression of D-dimer, fibrinogen (FIB), leukocyte, C-reactive protein (CRP) and tissue factor (TF) released from monocyte in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with or without venous thromboembolism (VTE) and analyze the correlation, to explore the possible mechanisms. Methods Seventy two patients confirmed the diagnosis of lung cancer, among whom 10 with VTE were enrolled into the study from November 2012 to January 2014 in the First Affiliated Hospital of Fujian Medical University, 30 healthy subjects were also enrolled as the control group. Ficoll and Percoll density gradient centrifugation separated of peripheral blood monocyte. Monocyte TF mRNA expression was detected using reverse transeriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Results There were significant differences in different stages of the cancer (P<0.05) and no significance among the histopathologic types (P>0.05) for the expression of monocyte TF mRNA in NSCLC patients, its expression was significantly higher in cancer with lymph node metastasis than those without lymph node metastasis (P<0.01).Meanwhile, in NSCLC patients with VTE, the expression of monocyte TF mRNA was significantly higher than that in patients without VTE (P<0.01). Difference of the survival curves between the low monocyte TF mRNA expression and the high monocyte TF mRNA expression was significant (Log-rank x2=4.923, P<0.05). Conclusions Monocyte TF may be a relevant source of TF-mediated thrombogenicity in NSCLC patients and may be associated with prognosis in NSCLC. This article is protected by copyright.
