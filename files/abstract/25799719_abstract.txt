Cavernous hemangioma is a very rare benign primary cardiac tumor that commonly involves any part of the heart, having been found in the atria, ventricles, interventricular septum, pericardium, and epicardium. A predominant location in the avascular cardiac valves is extremely rare, however. The case is reported of a 48-year-old male with recurrent anginal chest pain who subsequently underwent coronary angiography that revealed a mobile, rounded mass at the mitral valve which was fed by the left circumflex artery. Echocardiography revealed a left atrial echogenic mass attached to the posterior leaflet of the mitral valve. Histopathology of the mass following its surgical resection was consistent with hemangioma of the cavernous type. The patient recovered uneventfully. To the present authors' knowledge, this is the first reported case of cavernous hemangioma of the mitral valve in an adult male to be successfully treated with surgical resection.
