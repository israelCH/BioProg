Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) and Systemic Sclerosis (SSc) are predominantly female autoimmune diseases, therefore men are less well investigated. We analysed sex hormone levels in male patients with SLE and SSc comparatively to controls, in relation with use of corticosteroids and cyclophosphamide.Sex hormone levels were measured from fasting blood samples in male patients with SLE (n=71), SSc (n=29) and compared to population-based age-matched male controls. Relevant hormone profiles were identified using cluster analysis.Male SLE patients had higher levels of LH (p<0.0001) and more frequent bioactive testosterone deficiency (p=0.02) than their matched controls. Current dosage of prednisolone correlated inversely with the levels of bioactive testosterone (r=-0.36, p=0.03). Cluster analysis identified a subset of SLE patients with increased levels of FSH, LH, prolactin and lower levels of bioactive testosterone (p<0.0001), in relation with higher daily doses of prednisolone. In male SSc patients, levels of testosterone (p=0.03) and bioactive testosterone (p=0.02) were significantly lower than in matched-controls. Use of cyclophosphamide during the previous year was associated with lower bioactive testosterone levels in both SLE (p=0.02) and SSc (p=0.01) patients, after adjustment for age.Our study highlights the negative impact of corticosteroids on the gonadal function in male SLE. Further, use of cyclophosphamide during the year prior to inclusion impaired bioactive testosterone levels in SLE and SSc. Physicians should be more aware of the possibility of hypogonadism in male patients with autoimmune diseases. The need for hormonal supplementation remains to be formally evaluated in these patients.
