A new algorithm for comparison of protein dynamics is presented. Compared protein structures are superposed and their modes of motions are calculated using the Anisotropic Network Model. The obtained modes are aligned using the dynamic programming algorithm of Needleman and Wunsch, commonly used for sequence alignment. Dynamical comparison of Hemoglobin in the T and R2 states reveals that the dynamics of the allosteric effector 2,3-Bisphosphoglycerate binding site is different in the two states. These differences can contribute to the selectivity of the effector to the T state. Similar comparison of the ionotropic Glutamate Receptor in the kainate+(R,R)-2b and ZK bound states reveals that the kainate+(R,R)-2b bound states slow modes describe upward motions of ligand binding domain and the transmembrane domain regions. Such motions may lead to the opening of the receptor. The upper lobes of the LBDs of the ZK bound state have a smaller interface with the amino terminal domains above them and have a better ability to move together. The present study exemplifies the use of dynamics comparison as a tool to study protein function. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
