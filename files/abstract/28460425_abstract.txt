The Schlafen (slfn) gene family members express broadly, but the research has mainly focused on human slfn (h-slfn) and mouse slfn (m-slfn). The slfn members can be divided into three groups, and each group has its own characteristics and functions. Although the effects of slfns are still poorly understood, it has been confirmed that slfns are involved in the defense of immune system and regulate immune cells' proliferation and differentiation. In some malignant tumors, the slfn proteins can inhibit the growth and invasion of cancer cells, promote cancer cells sensibility to chemotherapeutics, and can be a promising new therapeutic target. In addition, the slfn proteins also disturb replication and virulence of viruses. In this review, we summarize the characteristics of the schlafen family's structures and functions with the aim to achieve a more comprehensive understanding of slfns.
