To investigate in a large sample the prevalence rates of accessory spleens located in the greater omentum and to explain the embryological background and the vascular supply of this rare congenital disorder.Evaluation of the presence of accessory spleens located in the greater omentum was performed in 5 different international anatomical centers investigating a total of 1,045 body donors. Arterial and venous blood supply and the precise location of the respective vasculature within the splenic ligaments are described based on dissection of this rare condition in a male specimen.The reported prevalence rates from 5 different centers were: 0.5% (out of 380 body donors), 0% (out of 230 donors), 0% (out of 200 donors), 2% (out of 200 donors), and 0% (out of 35 donors). The cumulative prevalence rate obtained from 1,045 anatomical dissections was 0.6%. The identified accessory spleen measured 3 ª 3 ª 2.5 cm and was located in the left upper abdominal quadrant. A vascular stag 7.5 cm in length was identified within the gastro-splenic ligament, containing an artery and a vein piercing the greater omentum from posterior.An accessory spleen located in the greater omentum is a rare congenital disorder. Physicians should be aware of the fact that in patients without any representative symptom history a nodular mass located within the greater omentum could be an accessory spleen.
