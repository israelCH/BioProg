We tested whether direct transcutaneous bilirubin (TcB) measurement from an area unexposed to phototherapy is reliable to estimate total serum bilirubin (TSB) in neonates during phototherapy and whether it contributes to a reduction in TSB blood sampling when deciding to discontinue phototherapy.We performed a retrospective observational study in term neonates who received phototherapy in the mother's room. TSB and TcB from the neonate's sternum were measured before and during phototherapy and compared with a linear regression analysis and a Bland-Altman plot, respectively. Various cutoff values of the TcB level to estimate the TSB levels during phototherapy at more than 72 h after birth were analyzed.There were moderate correlations between the TSB and TcB measurements before (r = 0.56) and during (r = 0.47) phototherapy in 125 neonates. The mean (S.D.) difference (TSB-TcB) before and during phototherapy was 1.2 (1.7) and 1.0 (1.7) mg/dL, respectively. The 95% limits of agreement for the difference before and during phototherapy ranged from -2.1 to 4.5 and from -2.3 to 4.3 mg/dL, respectively. For TSB levels ?18 mg/dL during phototherapy, a cutoff value for TcB of 14 mg/dL had a specificity of 1.0; with this method, 43% of the TSB measurements could have been avoided.Direct measurement of TcB levels during phototherapy using a bed-type device is a reliable method to estimate the TSB levels in term neonates and would contribute to a reduction in blood sampling. However, it cannot be used as a substitute for TSB measurements. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
