In their paper that is published in Toxicology in Vitro, Rachmawati et al. have recently claimed that in spite of the growing concern about the safety of amalgam, negative reports about the health effects of dental amalgam are still scarce or controversial. Substantial evidence indicates that mercury release from dental amalgam fillings may adversely affect human health. Over the past years, we have shown that exposure to electromagnetic fields (EMFs) can increase the release of mercury from dental amalgam fillings. It is worth mentioning that the results of investigations on the microleakage of amalgam fillings following MRI have confirmed our results. Furthermore, exposure to X-rays as a part of the electromagnetic spectrum has also been linked to increased mercury release from dental amalgam fillings. Considering the explosive rise in human exposure to electromagnetic fields, the role of human exposure to EMF as a key factor in increasing the release of mercury from dental amalgam restorations cannot be simply ignored.
