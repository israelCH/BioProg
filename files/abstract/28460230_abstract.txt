The present study investigates the effect of hesperidin; a flavonone commonly found in citrus fruits, on the ectoenzymes (ectonucleotidase and ecto-adenosine deaminase) activity, cell viability, apoptosis, cell cycle arrest and reactive oxygen species production in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from rat model of pleurisy. Wistar rats were pretreated with either saline or hesperidin (80mg/kg) by oral gavage for 21days and injected intrapleurally with 2% carrageenan or saline on the 22nd day. PBMCs were subsequently prepared after 4h of carrageenan induction. The results revealed that hesperidin may exhibit its anti-inflammatory effects through possible modulation of ectonucleotidase (E-NTPDase) and ecto-adenosine deaminase (E-ADA) activities, reduction of intracellular reactive oxygen species, prevention of DNA damage and modulation of apoptosis as well as activation of cell cycle arrest. This study suggests some possible underlying anti-inflammatory mechanisms of hesperidin on PBMCs in acute inflammatory condition. Furthermore, hesperidin may minimize oxidative injury mediated pleurisy in rat.
