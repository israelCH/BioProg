Adipose tissue can modulate disease processes in a depot-specific manner. However, the functional properties of perivascular adipocytes, and their influence on the pathophysiology of blood vessel walls, remain to be determined. In this study, we aimed to investigate whether perivascular adipose tissue could have an ameliorative effect on blood vessels damaged in diabetes. Using in vitro coculture, and in vivo transplantation model simulating diabetic angioplasty-induced injury, we showed that perivascular adipose tissue has an important function in protecting blood vessels from high glucose impairment. Levels of inflammatory cytokines, including intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1 and osteopontin, were markedly reduced, whereas that of endothelial nitric-oxide synthase was markedly elevated in vascular walls. These depot-specific differences in blood vessels exposed to high levels of glucose were demonstrable both in vivo, with transplanted adipose tissues, and in vitro, when vascular endothelial cells were cocultured with adipocytes. In addition, intimal hyperplasia was also decreased by transplanted perivascular adipose tissue after balloon injury combined with hyperglycemia. We conclude that perivascular adipocytes can reduce inflammation in blood vessels and promote the normal function of endothelium, which could afford a new therapeutic strategy in vascular walls damaged by diabetes.
