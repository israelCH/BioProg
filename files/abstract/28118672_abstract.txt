The fungal extract as well as the 3 biosynthetic compounds, (S)-(+)-2-cis-4-trans-abscisic acid (1), , 7'-hydroxy-abscisic acid (2) and 4-des-hydroxyl altersolanol A (3) from the endophytic fungus, Nigrospora oryzae, isolated from Combretum dolichopetalum leaf were investigated for their antidiabetic potential.The antidiabetic activity was determined in alloxan-induced diabetic mice by monitoring their fasting blood sugar for 9?h.The extract and the compounds (1-3) significantly (p<0.001) reduced the fasting blood sugar of the diabetic mice.The present study has shown that the biosynthetic products of the endophytic fungus, N. oryzae, exhibited strong antidiabetic activity. It has further shown that endophytic fungi could be an alternative source of novel compounds for management of diabetes.
