Donation after circulatory death (DCD) has experienced a significant expansion over the last decade. However, warm ischemia results in a greater risk for transplantation. Indeed, controlled DCD (cDCD) was associated with inferior outcomes compared to donation after brain death. The use of abdominal normothermic regional perfusion (nRP) to restore blood flow prior to organ recovery in cDCD has been proposed as a better alternative than rapid recovery to reverse the effect of ischemia and improve recipients' outcome. The first Spanish series using abdominal nRP as in situ conditioning method is reported. A specific methodology to avoid restoring circulation to the brain after death determination is described. Twenty-seven cDCD donors underwent abdominal nRP during at least 60 minutes. Thirty-seven kidneys, 11 livers, 6 bilateral lungs and 1 pancreas were transplanted. One year death-censored kidney survival was 91% and delayed graft function was 27%. One year liver survival was 90.1% with no case of ischemic cholangiopathy. Lungs and pancreas transplants performed exhibited primary function. The use of nRP may represent an advance to increase the number and quality of grafts in cDCD. Poor results in cDCD livers could be reversed with nRP. Concerns about restoring brain circulation after death are easily solved. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
