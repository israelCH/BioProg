The controlled induction of hemeoxygenase-1 (HO-1), an enzyme that catabolizes heme, has been shown to reduce heme, preventing pathologies associated with heme toxicity. The hemoglobin genotype HbAS confers reduced susceptibility to severe complications of malaria by a mechanism that is not well understood. Using a longitudinal approach, we investigated the effect of baseline concentrations of HO-1 on the accumulation of heme during acute Plasmodium falciparum malaria in HbAS and HbAA genotypes. Plasma concentrations of heme, HO-1, and cytokines were quantified in venous blood obtained from children (9 months-5 years of age) during malaria infection, and at convalescence (baseline levels). Parasitemia was determined during malaria infection. In patients with the HbAA genotype, there was a significant elevation in the plasma concentration of heme (P=0.002), and a consequent increased induction of HO-1 (P<0.001) during falciparum malaria compared with levels at convalescence. Contrary to HbAA, plasma concentration of heme did not change in HbAS genotypic group (P=0.110), and the induction of HO-1 was reduced during malaria compared with levels at convalescence (P=0.006). Higher plasma levels of heme were observed in HbAS compared with HbAA at convalescence (P=0.010) but this difference did not affect the levels of HO-1 within each genotype (P=0.450). Relatively milder pro-inflammatory responses were observed in HbAS children during malaria infection compared to HbAA children. Our findings suggest that a mechanism of reduced susceptibility to severe malaria pathologies by the HbAS genotype may involve the control of heme, leading to controlled levels of HO-1 and milder pro-inflammatory responses during acute malaria.
