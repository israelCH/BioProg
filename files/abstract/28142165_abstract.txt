The term "luxury foodstuffs" refers to foods which are not consumed because of their nutritional value. Classic modern luxury foodstuffs are alcohol, caffeine-containing drinks, cocoa, sugar and tobacco. The following review article examines some of these modern luxury foodstuffs in detail, as well as their influence on glaucoma. Thus, small quantities of alcohol lower high intraocular pressure and have a positive influence on the blood circulation of the optic nerve. In addition, red wine polyphenols exert vasoprotective effects. In general, however, alcohol consumption appears to have no significant effect on the prevalence of glaucoma. The most important source of caffeine intake is coffee consumption. In some studies, coffee consumption caused no changes in intraocular pressure, while others reported a rise. A large study showed a connection between heavy coffee consumption and the risk of pseudoexfoliation glaucoma. Green and black teas are rich sources of flavonoids with antioxidant activity. In addition, a slight trend for lowering the intraocular pressure has been measured. As regards chocolate, flavonoid-rich dark chocolate should be favoured, due to its antioxidant activity. It lowers blood pressure and improves endothelium-dependent vascular relaxation. Excessive sugar consumption over many years can lead to increased body mass index (BMI) and type 2 diabetes. Many studies show a positive relationship between BMI and intraocular pressure. Some studies have identified significant correlations between type 2 diabetes and the risk of glaucoma. Smoking is a very widespread stimulant; it narrows the blood vessels and thus reduces the blood circulation of the optic nerve. Otherwise, studies on the role of smoking as a risk factor for glaucoma have been very inconsistent. Luxury foodstuffs may effect glaucoma and should be included in the medical history.
