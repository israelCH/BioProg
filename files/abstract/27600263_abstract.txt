This paper reports on the optimization, characterization, and applicability of gas chromatography coupled to triple-quadrupole tandem mass spectrometry (GC-QqQ(MS/MS)) for the determination of 14 polybrominated diphenylethers (PBDEs) and 2 emerging brominated flame retardants, 1,2-bis(2,4,6-tribromophenoxy)ethane (BTBPE) and decabromodiphenylethane (DBDPE), in functional food samples. The method showed satisfactory precision and linearity with instrumental limits of detection (iLODs) ranging from 0.12 to 7.1 pg, for tri- to octa-BDEs and BTBPE, and equal to 51 and 20 pg for BDE-209 and DBDPE, respectively. The highest ?BFR concentrations were found in fish oil supplements (924 pg/g fresh weight, fw), followed by biscuits (90 pg/g fw), vegetable oil supplements (46 pg/g fw), chicken eggs (45 pg/g fw), cow's milk (7.7 pg/g fw), and soy products (1.6 pg/g fw). BDE-47, BDE-99, and DBDPE were the most abundant compounds. Foodstuffs enriched with omega-3 presented concentrations similar to or even lower than those of conventional foods commercialized in Spain since 2000.
