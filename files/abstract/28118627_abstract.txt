Effective delivery of continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) depends on the longevity of the filter and circuit used in the CRRT machine. Safe and effective anticoagulation is crucial for maintaining the patency of these circuits. In children, heparin and citrate are the commonly used anticoagulants but they are limited by serious side effects and thus calls for meticulous monitoring. In conditions where neither of these can be used, prostacyclin can be an effective alternative. Prostacyclin is a platelet inhibitor that can be safely used as an efficient anticoagulant in CRRT. When combined with heparin, it induces a heparin-sparing effect, which can reduce the dosage and side effects of heparin. Furthermore, there is no need for performing time-consuming monitoring tests. Although prostacyclin seems to be an attractive option, there is scanty evidence about its use as an anticoagulant in CRRT in children. We review the evidence and practicalities, and propose a guideline for the use of prostacyclin as an anticoagulant in children requiring CRRT.
