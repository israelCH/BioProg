Navasard Vaganovich Karapetyan (September 6, 1936-March 6, 2015) began his scientific career at the Bach Institute of Biochemistry of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow, and was associated with this institute for over 56 years. He worked in the area of biochemistry and biophysics of photosynthesis and was especially known for his studies on chlorophyll a fluorescence in higher plants and cyanobacteria, molecular organization of Photosystem I, photoprotective energy dissipation, and dynamics of energy migration in the two photosystems. We present here a brief biography and comments on the work of Navasard Karapetyan. We remember him as an enthusiastic person who had an unflagging curiosity, energy and profound sincere interest in many aspects of photosynthesis research.
