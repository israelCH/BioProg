The treatment of hydatid cysts of the liver opened in the bile ducts is sometimes difficult and complex. The trans-hepaticocystic coledochostomy (CTHK) is one of these processes. We conducted a review of the indications for this surgical procedure and its perioperative outcomes through a series of 25 patients and then we analyzed predictor factors of complications. During the period's study, 909 patients with liver hydatid cyst went under the surgery. Ninety two (92, i.e. 10.1%) of them had an opening in the bile ducts through a large fistula. Twenty five (25, i.e. 27%) had a trans-hepaticocystic coledochostomy. The sex ratio was 0.6. The population was young with an average age of 47 years. The trans-hepaticocystic coledochostomy was performed because of a thick pericyst associated with a nonsutured fistula in 18 cases, a voluminous residual cavity with a soft pericyst but the fistula was unexposed in six cases and in a case where the pericyst was thick, fistula was exposed. Its suture was associated with a high risk of bile duct stenosis. Specific morbidity was 20% due to a length of the intraductal coledochostomy under 2 cm (P = 0.016), the absence of an epiploplasty (P = 0.004) and the existence of a leak of contrast material outside the fistula on the cholangiography (P = 0.005). The trans-hepaticocystic coledochostomy is a safe and reliable technique, often indicated when other conservative methods are failing. The application of its technical requirements and avoidance of mounting errors allow reducing its morbidity.
