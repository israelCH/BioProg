Human Respiratory syncytial virus (hRSV) is the major cause of respiratory tract infection in both children and adults, virtually all children acquire infection with hRSV by the age of 3 years. Two subgroups of the virus, hRSV-A and hRSV-B based on sequence variability of G protein gene are divided into 11 and 17 genotypes respectively. Very limited data regarding circulating genotypes is available from India. This study aimed to detect and characterize the circulating genotype of hRSV from central India. Throat swabs collected from patient's having influenza like illness (ILI) were subjected to RT-PCR for diagnosis, further sequencing and phylogenetic analysis was performed using primers specific for C-terminal end of G gene. Out of 526 tested samples 62 (12%) were found positive, 90% cases were from children under 3 year age children. Both hRSV-A and hRSV-B were detected in equal proportions. Sequence analysis of 15 samples revealed circulation of genotypes NA1, ON1 of hRSV-A and BA9 of hRSV-B. We advocate molecular surveillance of hRSV for better patient management and epidemiological monitoring. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
