Aquatic organisms are increasingly exposed to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) due to anthropogenic pressure. This study aimed at evaluating the response of Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) in scallop Chlamys farreri against benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) and chrysene (CHR) exposure under laboratory conditions. Nine published GST genes were classified into six subfamilies and a new member of rho family was identified for the first time. Twelve GSTs (including nine published GST genes and three in transcriptome established by our laboratory) mRNA transcript levels in the gills, digestive glands, adductor muscle, mantle, testis, ovaries, blood cells of scallops were measured by real-time PCR. The results showed that the mRNA transcript levels of twelve GSTs, except GST-zeta, GST-mu and GST-microsomal, were highest in digestive gland. Accordingly, the mRNA expression levels of GSTs were measured in digestive glands of scallops exposed to BaP (0.1?g/L and 1?g/L), CHR (0.1?g/L and 1?g/L) and their mixtures (0.1?g/L BaP +0.1?g/L CHR and 1?g/L BaP +1?g/L CHR). The results indicated that different GST had specific response to different pollution exposure. In BaP exposure experiment, the mRNA expression level of GST-theta was a potential suitable biomarker. GST-sigma-2 and GST-3, which belonged to sigma class, were sensitive to CHR exposure while GST-microsomal was considered a potential ideal bioindicator to joint exposure of BaP and CHR. In summary, this study investigated the classification of GSTs and provided information about the expression profiles of different class GSTs after PAHs exposure.
