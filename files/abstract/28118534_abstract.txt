In RA, autoreactive B cells are pathogenic drivers and sources of anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPA) that serve as a diagnostic biomarker and predictor of worse long-term prognosis. Yet the immunobiologic significance of persistent ACPA production at a cellular level is poorly understood.In a cross-sectional study of RA patients, we investigated for the presence of continued defects in immune homeostasis as a function of disease activity. Using an ELISA and a sensitive multiplex bead-based immunoassay, we characterized fine-binding antibody-specificities in sera, synovial fluid (SF) and B-cell culture supernatants. In this manner, we determined the frequency and epitope reactivity patterns of ACPA produced by SF B cells and switched-memory blood B cells, and compared the latter to serum ACPA levels and disease activity scores.Cultured B cells from SF were shown to spontaneously secrete ACPA, while constitutive IgG-autoantibody production by PBMC was substantially less frequent. After in vitro stimulation, PBMC secreted IgG ACPA that was overwhelmingly from switched-memory B-cells, across all patient groups treated with MTX and/or a TNF-inhibitor. Intriguingly, frequencies of ACPA-producing switched-memory B cells significantly correlated with serum IgG anti-CCP3 (r=0.57, p=0.003). Moreover, treatment-induced clinical remission had little or no effect on the circulating burden of switched-memory ACPA-producing B cells, in part explaining the continued dysregulation of humoral immunity.Our findings rationalize why therapeutic cessation most often results in disease reactivation and clinical flare. Hence, a clinical disease activity score is not a reliable indicator of the resolution of pathologic recirculating B-cell autoimmunity. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
