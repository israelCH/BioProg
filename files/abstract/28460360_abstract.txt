Lysine specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) is a flavin-dependent amine oxidase that selectively removes one or two methyl groups from H3 at Lys4 and is recognized as a promising therapeutic target for cancer and other diseases. Here, a series of 3-oxoamino-benzenesulfonamides were synthesized and evaluated for their inhibitory activity against LSD1. Compounds 7b and 7h showed the most potent inhibition with the IC50 values of 9.5 and 6.9?M, respectively. Furthermore, the LSD1 inhibition of 7b and 7h were reversible and selective. Docking study presented the possible binding mode between 7b, 7h and the LSD1 active site. Taken together, 3-oxoamino-benzenesulfonamides may represent a new class of reversible LSD1 inhibitors and 7b and 7h were two hit compounds deserved further structural optimization.
