Interferon (IFN)-? is implicated in the pathogenesis of discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE). This study evaluated a single dose of AMG 811, an anti-IFN-? antibody, in subjects with DLE.This was a phase 1, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study (sequence 1: AMG 811 followed by placebo; sequence 2: placebo followed by AMG 811). Subjects received a single subcutaneous dose of AMG 811 (180 mg) or placebo. Pharmacodynamic endpoints included global transcriptional analyses of lesional and nonlesional skin, IFN-? Blockade Signature (IGBS) transcriptional score in skin and blood, keratinocyte IFN-? RNA score, and serum CXCL-10 protein. Additional endpoints included efficacy (including Cutaneous Lupus Erythematosus Disease Area and Severity Index; CLASI(TM) ) and safety outcomes.Sixteen subjects enrolled (9 in sequence 1; 7 in sequence 2) in this study. AMG 811 treatment reduced the IGBS score (elevated at baseline) in both blood and lesional skin. The keratinocyte IFN-? RNA score was not affected with AMG 811 treatment. Serum CXCL-10 protein (elevated in blood of DLE subjects) was reduced with AMG 811 treatment. AMG 811 treatment was well tolerated, but did not lead to statistically significant improvements in efficacy outcomes.AMG 811 treatment led to changes in IFN-?-associated biomarkers and was well tolerated, but no significant clinical benefit was observed in subjects with DLE.
