A 22-month old child with thalassaemia major received unrelated umbilical cord blood transplantation. She was born to mother of HBsAg carrier and received hepatitis B immunoglobulin at birth and hepatitis B vaccination. She was HBsAg negative and anti-HBs positive before transplantation. After transplant, she was taken care by her mother and found to be HBsAg positive at 2 year post-transplant. Genotyping of the mother's and child's HBV status confirmed to be of same genotype and demonstrated horizontal transmission in post-transplant setting. Passive immunization of HBV may be considered in early post-transplant phase to prevent horizontal transmission of HBV, and antiviral treatment of the carer should be offered to prevent transmission of infection to immunocompromised child.
