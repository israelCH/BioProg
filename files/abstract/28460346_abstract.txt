Six new monosulfated triterpene glycosides, cladolosides I1 (1), I2 (2), J1 (3), K1 (4), K2 (5) and L1 (6) were isolated from the tropical Indo-West Pacific sea cucumber Cladolabes schmeltzii (Cladolabinae, Sclerodactylidae, Dendrochirotida). Structures of these glycosides were elucidated by 2D NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry. Four new types of carbohydrate chains have been found in 1-6. Cladolosides of the groups I and J are characterized by pentasaccharide carbohydrate chains sulfated at a terminal 3-O-methylglucose residue and branched by the position 4 of the first xylose residue, but differing from each other in the lengths of the main and side carbohydrate chains. Cladolosides of the groups K and L contain hexasaccharide chains with different positions of a sulfated terminal 3-O-methylglucose residue (as the fourth or the sixth monosaccharide residue). Sulfated hexasaccharide carbohydrate chains were found in the sea cucumbers glycosides for the first time. A pentasaccharide carbohydrate chain of cladoloside J1 (3) having a disaccharide moiety of glucose and a sulfated 3-O-methylglucose linked to the first xylose residue in a linear trisaccharide fragment is also unusual. All substances studied demonstrated strong or moderate hemolytic and cytotoxic effects.
