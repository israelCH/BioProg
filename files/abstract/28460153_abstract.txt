A beneficial impact of the Human Pegivirus (HPgV) - formerly called GB virus C (GBV-C) - on HIV disease progression has been reported previously. One possible mechanism by which HPgV inhibits HIV replication is an alteration of the cytokine/chemokine milieu. Their expression has not been specifically evaluated in women despite their influence on disease progression and the possibility of gender-based differences in expression. Moreover, the impact of HPgV genotype on cytokine/chemokine expression is unknown. Sera levels of IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12p70, IL-13, IFN?, TNF?, IP-10, MIP-1?, MIP-1?, and TGF-?1 were quantified in 150 HIV-positive women based on HPgV RNA status. Cytokines/chemokines with detection rates of at least 50% included IL-2, IL-4, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12p70, IFN?, TNF?, IP-10, MIP-1?, MIP-1?, and TGF-?1 . Absolute values were significantly higher for HPgV positive compared to HPgV negative women for IL-7, IL-13, IL-12p70, and IFN?. Absolute values were significantly lower for HPgV positive women for IL-4, IL-8, TGF-?1 , and IP-10. IFN? values were higher for HPgV genotype 2 than for genotype 1 (p?=?0.036). Further study of cytokine/chemokine regulation by HPgV may ultimately lead to the development of novel therapeutic agents to treat HIV infection and/or the design of vaccine strategies that mimic the 'protective' effects of HPgV replication.
