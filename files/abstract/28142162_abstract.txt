Purpose To investigate the state of dark adaptation and macular blood flow in different forms of glaucoma. Methods Eighteen eyes of 18 patients with primary open-angle glaucoma, 14 eyes of 14 patients with pseudoexfoliation glaucoma, and 10 eyes of 10 patients with childhood glaucoma (CG) were examined by means of dark adaptometry, scanning-laser retinal flowmetry, and retinal tomography. Results All glaucomatous eyes had comparable optic disc excavation (one-way ANOVA, p?=?0.138). Eyes with CG had significantly lower best-corrected visual acuity than the other groups (Tukey, all p?<?0.0001). Macular perfusion was comparable in all three groups (one - way ANOVA, p?=?0.08). The delay in rod-cone break time in the CG group was significantly higher than in the other groups (Tukey, all p?<?0.0001). The scotopic sensitivity threshold in the CG group was significantly greater than in the other groups (Tukey, all p?<?0.01). Conclusion This underlying dysfunction of dark adaptation may contribute, at least to some extent, to the decreased visual perception observed in patients with CG.
