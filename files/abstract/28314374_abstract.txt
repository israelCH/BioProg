Antibodies that cross-react with multiple HIV-1 envelopes (Envs) are useful reagents for characterizing Env proteins and for soluble Env capture and purification assays. We previously reported ten murine monoclonal antibodies induced by group M consensus Env, CON-6 immunization. Each demonstrated broad cross-reactivity to recombinant Envs. Here we characterized the Env epitopes to which they bind. Seven mapped to linear epitopes in gp120, five at the Env N-terminus and two at the Env C-terminus. One antibody, 13D7, bound at the gp120 N-terminus (aa 30-42), reacted with HIV-1-infected CD4+ T cells, and when expressed in a human IgG1 backbone, mediated ADCC. Antibody 18F11 bound at the gp120 C-terminus (aa 445-459) and reactivity was glycan-dependent. Antibodies 13D7, 3B3, and 16H3 bound to 100 percent of HIV-1 Envs tested in ELISA and SDS-PAGE/Western blot analysis. These data define the epitopes of monoclonal antibody reagents for characterization of recombinant Envs, one epitope of which is also expressed on the surface of HIV-1 infected CD4+ T cells.
