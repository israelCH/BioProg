: Vasoplegia syndrome is a potentially life-threatening condition that can occur following cardiopulmonary bypass. Heart transplantation is a recognized risk factor for developing this vasodilatory state. The objective of this study was to determine the effects of vasoplegia syndrome on 1-year heart transplant outcomes.: A retrospective review of orthotopic heart transplants at a single institution between November 2010 and December 2014 was performed. Of the 347 consecutive adult patients, 107 patients (30.8%) met criteria for vasoplegia syndrome. Preoperative factors and intraoperative variables were collected and compared between vasoplegia and non-vasoplegia cohorts. The incidence of postoperative complications, transplant rejection and patient survival within 1 year were evaluated.: Demographics and preoperative medication profiles were similar in both groups, while mechanical circulatory support device use was associated with vasoplegia syndrome (30.8% vs 20.0%; P? = ? 0.039). Perioperative characteristics such as longer cardiopulmonary bypass [165.0 (interquartile range [IQR] 74) min vs 140.0 (IQR 42.7) min; P? < ? 0.001] and increased blood product usage (24.7?±?17.2 units vs 17.7?±?14.3 units; P? < ? 0.001) were associated with vasoplegia. Non-vasoplegia patients were more likely to be extubated [42.9 (IQR 37.3) h vs 66.8 (IQR 50.2) h; P? < ? 0.001] and discharged earlier [10.0 (IQR 6) days vs 14.0 (IQR 11.5) days; P? < ? 0.001]. One-year patient survival (92.0% vs 88.6%; P? = ? 0.338) and any-treated rejection rates (82.7% vs 84.3%; P? = ? 0.569) were not significantly different between groups.: Although vasoplegia syndrome was associated with an increase in perioperative morbidity, including greater mechanical ventilation time and hospital length of stay, no significant differences in survival or allograft rejection at 1 year was demonstrated.
