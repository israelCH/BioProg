Electronic cigarettes (ECs) can influence nicotine addiction by delivering aerosolized nicotine. We investigated if nicotine from ECs is delivered to the brain ?2*-nicotinic-acetylcholine receptors (?2*-nAChR) and how this relates to the behavioral effects and nicotine delivery from cigarettes.Seven nicotine users participated in positron emission tomography (PET) studies with (-)-[18F]Flubatine before and after nicotine challenge with 0, 8 mg/ml, and 36 mg/ml nicotine in a 3.3 Volt, 1.5 Ohm EC or a standard tobacco cigarette. Craving was evaluated before and after product use.Average ?2*-nAChR occupancy was higher after 36 mg/ml EC challenge compared to 8 mg/ml EC at trend level. Average ?2*-nAChR occupancy after tobacco cigarette smoking was 68±18% and was not different compared with 8 mg/ml (64±17%,) or 36 mg/ml (84±3%) nicotine in EC users. Area under the curve (AUC) of blood nicotine level was higher in the cigarette smoking group compared with the 8mg/ml group (p=0.03), but similar compared with the 36 mg/ml EC (p=0.29). Drug craving was reduced after use of the tobacco cigarette, 8 mg/ml EC, and 36 mg/ml EC.In this novel investigation of EC effects at ?2*-nAChRs, we show that average ?2*-nAChR occupancy was higher after 36 mg/ml EC challenge compared with 8 mg/ml EC. Receptor occupancy and arterial blood nicotine levels after cigarette smoking were similar to 36 mg/ml EC use under controlled conditions. These findings suggest that the ECs studied here have abuse liability and may provide an adequate alternative nicotine delivery system for cigarette smokers.This is the first study to directly determine the neurologic effects of electronic cigarettes on human brain beta-2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors using PET neuroimaging with (-)-[18F]Flubatine, a novel radiotracer. Our findings suggest that the e-cigarettes studied here have abuse liability and may provide an adequate alternative nicotine delivery system for cigarette smokers.
