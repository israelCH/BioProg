Immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN) is the most common glomerulonephritis in the world, but there is little epidemiological data about possible changes in its presentation over the years. Available information about the influence of age on the form of clinical presentation is also scarce.The aim of the study was to analyse all renal biopsies performed between 1994 and 2013 and recorded in the Spanish Registry of Glomerulonephritis with a histological diagnosis of IgAN. The study was divided into five 4-year periods (1994-97, 1998-2001, 2002-05, 2006-09 and 2010-13) and patients were divided into four age groups: ?16, 17-44, 45-64 and ?65 years.From 20.974 renal biopsies recorded, 2961 (14.1%) corresponded to IgAN. The prevalence of IgAN remained stable, but a significant increase in age [from 37.6 (SD 17.7) in 1994-97 to 44.9 (SD 16.8) years in 2010-13; P?=?0.001] and worse renal function at presentation [from serum creatinine (SCr) 1.9 (SD 1.9) in 1994-97 to 2.3 (SD 2.1) mg/dL in 2010-13; P?=?0.001] were observed over the years. Nephrotic-range proteinuria and acute kidney injury (AKI) as forms of presentation were significantly more common among patients ?65 years (17.7% and 43.2%, respectively) as compared with the other age groups [?16 (11.4% and 13.1%, respectively), 17-44 (13.1% and 13%, respectively) and 45-64 (12.1% and 21.3%, respectively)]. Blood pressure, SCr and proteinuria were also significantly higher at presentation among elderly patients.Although the prevalence of IgAN in Spain has remained stable over the years, patients are significantly older and present with significantly worse renal function in the last years. The incidence of nephrotic-range proteinuria (17.7%) and AKI (43.2%) as forms of presentation is remarkable among patients ?65 years of age.
