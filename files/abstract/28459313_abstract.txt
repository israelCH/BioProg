The study aimed to explore the adjustment of Jewish and Arab mothers of children diagnosed with cancer.Ninety-seven Jewish and 100 Arab mothers completed questionnaires assessing mastery, social support, and adjustment indices: psychological distress, quality of life and future fears and hopes.Arab mothers were higher than Jewish mothers on distress and lower on social support and future hopes. Mastery and social support contributed independently to adjustment indices. Ethnicity moderated the effects of mastery and social support on adjustment.Ethnicity, mastery and social support are important factors in mothers' adjustment to their child's cancer.
