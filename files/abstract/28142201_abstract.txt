Ageing is associated with changes in the peripheral T-cell immune system, which can be significantly influenced by latent cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection. To what extent changes in circulating T-cell populations correlate with T-cell composition of the lymph node (LN) is unclear, but crucial for a comprehensive understanding of the T-cell system.T cells from peripheral blood (PB) and LN of end-stage renal disease patients were analyzed for frequency of recent thymic emigrants using CD31 expression and T-cell receptor excision circle content, relative telomere length and expression of differentiation markers.Compared with PB, LN contained relatively more CD4(+) than CD8(+) T cells (p<0.001). The percentage of na?ve and central memory CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells and thymic output parameters, showed a strong linear correlation between PB and LN. Highly differentiated CD28(null) T cells, being CD27(-) , CD57(+) or PD-1(+) were almost exclusively found in the circulation but not in LN. An age-related decline in na?ve CD4(+) and CD8(+) T-cell frequency was observed (p=0.035 and p=0.002 respectively) within LN, concomitant with an increase in central memory CD8(+) T cells (p=0.033). Latent CMV infection dramatically increased the frequency of circulating terminally differentiated T cells, but did not significantly alter T-cell composition and ageing parameters of LN.Overall T-cell composition and measures of thymic function in PB and LN are strongly correlated. However, highly differentiated CD28(null) T cells, which may comprise a large part of circulating T cells in CMV-seropositive individuals, are almost exclusively found within the circulation.
