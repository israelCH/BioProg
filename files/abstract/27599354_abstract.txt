We have developed a two-photon fluorescent tracer (Pyr-affibody) that shows high selectivity for human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER-2). Pyr-affibody showed absorption and emission maxima at 439 and 574 nm, respectively, with a two-photon absorption cross-section value of 40 ª 10(-50)cm(4)s/photon (GM) at 750 nm in aqueous buffer solution. The effective two-photon action cross-section value measured in HeLa cells was 600 GM at 730 nm, a value sufficient to obtain bright two-photon microscopy (TPM) images. Using Pyr-affibody, it was possible to detect HER-2 over-expressing cells and breast cancers at a depth of 90-130 ?m in live mouse tissue by TPM.
