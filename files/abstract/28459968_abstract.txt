Specific human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DRB1 alleles encode a "shared epitope" (SE) associated with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), especially more severe cyclic-citrullinated peptide antibody-positive (anti-CCP+) RA. Associations of SE alleles (0, 1 or 2) with total and cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality and incident coronary heart disease (CHD), CVD and malignancy over mean (SD) = 8.9(3.5) years of follow-up were evaluated, stratified by baseline anti-CCP (+ vs. -). The longitudinal Women's Health Initiative (WHI) -RA study (1993-2010), sampled postmenopausal women who reported RA at baseline (1993-1998) or follow-up in WHI, classified as anti-CCP+ RA (n = 556) or anti-CCP- not RA (n = 1,070). Among anti-CCP+ RA women, SE alleles were not related to age-adjusted risks of CHD, CVD, malignancy, or total or CVD mortality. Among anti-CCP- not RA women, age-adjusted HR (95% CI) for 1 and 2 vs. 0 SE alleles were 0.41 (0.34, 0.50) and 0.44 (0.27, 0.72) for CVD, 0.49 (0.38, 0.63) and 0.26 (0.11, 0.64) for CHD, and 0.62 (0.53, 0.73) and 0.52 (0.33, 0.83) for malignancy. Associations persisted adjusted for CVD risk factors, joint pain, rheumatoid factor+, and inflammatory markers (white blood cell count or cytokines.) Future studies should evaluate SE associations among anti-CCP- adults without RA, and potential mechanisms.
