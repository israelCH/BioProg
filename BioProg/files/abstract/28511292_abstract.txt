Objective To investigate the relationship between intestinal inflammation and the central and peripheral innate immune system, in the pathogenesis of HLA-B27 associated spondyloarthritis. Methods The myeloid compartment of the bone marrow and blood of HLA-B27 transgenic (B27), control HLA-B7 transgenic (B7), and non-transgenic rats were evaluated by flow cytometry. Plasma from rats were assessed by ELISA for CCL2 and IL-1? levels. Rats were treated for 4 weeks with antibiotics and the blood and bone marrow myeloid compartments were evaluated by flow cytometry. The osteoclastogenic potential of bone marrow cells from antibiotic treated rats, in the presence or absence of TNF?, was evaluated in vitro. Results B27 rats have substantially higher numbers of circulating Lin(-) CD172a(+) CD43(l) ° monocytes than control animals, which significantly correlates with higher levels of plasma CCL2. Antibiotic treatment of B27 rats markedly reduced ileitis, plasma CCL2 and IL-1? levels, and the number of bone marrow and blood Lin(-) CD172a(+) CD43(l) ° monocytes, which have the greatest in vitro osteoclastogenic potential. Antibiotic treatment also prevented the TNF?-dependent enhancement of osteoclastogenesis in transgenic B27 rats. Conclusions The microbiota-dependent intestinal inflammation in B27 rats directly drives the systemic inflammatory and bone erosive potential of the monocyte compartment.
