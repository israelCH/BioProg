Evidence on biological plausibility from mechanistic studies and highly consistent data from observational studies raise the possibility that optimizing vitamin D status may reduce risk of type 2 diabetes. However, the observational nature of cohort studies precludes a definitive assessment of cause and effect because residual confounding or reverse causation cannot be excluded. Confounding is especially problematic with studies of vitamin D because blood 25-hydoxyvitamin D concentration is not only an excellent biomarker of vitamin D status, reflecting intake or biosynthesis, but also an excellent marker of good overall health. Results from underpowered trials and post-hoc analyses of trials designed for non-diabetic outcomes do not support a role of vitamin D supplementation for prevention of type 2 diabetes among people with normal glucose tolerance. Whether vitamin D supplementation may have a role in prevention of diabetes in high-risk populations remains to be seen. Adequately powered, randomized trials in well-defined populations (e.g., pre-diabetes) are ongoing and are expected to establish whether vitamin D supplementation lowers risk of diabetes.
