The increase in cardiovascular diseases requires the search for ways to predict complications based on research additional to traditional risk factors, conduct a study of the formation mechanisms of these complications and to design new treatment strategies.To get an idea about the relationship between inflammation in the blood vessels, atherosclerosis and cardiovascular consequences based on the study of the role of biomarkers of inflammation.the literature on the estimation of risk development of cardiovascular diseases based on the study of the role of biomarkers of vascular inflammation; bibliographic, a systematic approach.Algorithm stratification of cardiovascular risk includes a review of the traditional risk factors for the purpose of preventive therapy. A large number of cases of cardiovascular events (myocardial infarction, stroke) occurs in bessimptomnom patients with normal lipid. The use of additional risk factors for development of cerebral and cardiac disorders will allow to foresee the consequences and to prevent mortality from cardiovascular disease. Study of the role of inflammation in development of cardiovascular diseases allows the use of SB and PL-???2 as an important additional cardiovascular markers, independent of traditional risk factors.The use of biomarkers LP-???2 and SB specific to vascular inflammation, allows to establish the relationship between endovascular inflammation, atherosclerosis development and progression of cardiovascular diseases and to prevent cerebral and cardiac disorders in patients with traditional risk factor .
