In the beginning of the 19th century, apoplexy was understood to be a disease of the cerebral blood vessels, manifesting with a sudden weakening or extinction of sensation and the patient's inability to move. In this study, we examined the situation of neurology in the beginning of the 19th century in Vilnius through the perspective of a nervous system disease - apoplexy. Case reports and descriptions of apoplexy in the textbook and memoirs by Joseph Frank (1771-1842), descriptions of patients with apoplexy from the proceedings of Vilnius University Clinic were analysed. It was identified that the main cause of apoplexy was not an imbalance of the four humours but the pathology of cerebral blood vessels. However, following ancient tradition, the principles of recreation and moderation were thought to be important for the prevention of apoplexy, and bloodletting and diet were believed to be essential for the treatment.
