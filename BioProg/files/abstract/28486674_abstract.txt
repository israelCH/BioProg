Recent studies have reported robust associations of long-term PM2.5 exposure with DNA methylation-based measures of aging; yet, the molecular implications of these relationships remain poorly understood. We evaluated if genetic variation in three biological pathways implicated in PM2.5-related disease - oxidative stress, endothelial function, and metal processing - could modify the effect of PM2.5 on DNAm-age, one prominent DNA methylation-based measure of biological age. This analysis was based on 552 individuals from the Normative Aging Study with at least one visit between 2000 and 2011 (n?=?940 visits). A genetic-score approach was used to calculate aging-risk variant scores for endothelial function, oxidative stress, and metal processing pathways. One-year PM2.5 and PM2.5 component (sulfate and ammonium) levels at participants' addresses were estimated using the GEOS-chem transport model. Blood DNAm-age was calculated using CpG sites on the Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip. In fully-adjusted linear mixed-effects models, the effects of sulfate on DNAm-age (in years) were greater in individuals with high aging-risk endothelial function variant scores when compared to individuals with low aging-risk endothelial function variant scores (Pinteraction=0.0007; ?High=1.09, 95%CIHigh: 0.70, 1.48; ?Low=0.40, 95%CILow: 0.14, 0.67). Similar trends were observed in fully-adjusted models of ammonium and total PM2.5 alone. No effect modification was observed by oxidative stress and metal processing variant scores. Secondary analyses revealed significant associations of serum endothelial markers, ICAM1 (??=?0.01, 95%CI: 0.002, 0.012) and VCAM1 (??=?0.002, 95%CI: 0.0005, 0.0026), with DNAm-age. Our results add novel evidence that endothelial physiology may be important to DNAm-age relationships, but further research is required to establish their generalizability.
