The most common reason of chronic pancreatitis is liver and bile ducts disease: functional disorders, chronic cholecystitis, cholelithiasis and cholecystectomy in medical history. All these changes are associated with the colloidal structure of bile, increased lithogenicity, gallstones formation, Oddi's sphincter dysfunction, dysmotility and inflammation in the bile ducts.to study the effectiveness of using medicine Liveria IC (metadoxine) in standard therapy as well as effect on spectrum of blood serum lipids and structural condition of liver (stiffness) and pancreas in patients with chronic biliary pancreatitis combined with obesity.115 patients suffering from chronic biliary pancreatitis and obesity were the subjects of the study. They were compared to etiological factor socioeconomic conditions and nutrition (regular food 5 times a day without aggressive food (fatty, spicy, sour, fried products)). Also the effect of the alcohol factor was excluded.The obtained decrease in stiffness of the liver and pancreas indicates an improvement of their structural state.Using medication LiveriaIC (metadoxine) as the part of the complex therapy for the patients who are suffering from CBP combined with obesity gives some improvement of the lipid profile indices and the structural condition of liver and pancreas (according to the data of SWE) (?<0.05).
