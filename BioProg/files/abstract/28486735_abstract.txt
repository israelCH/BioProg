This study aimed to investigate whether sedentary time (Sed) and physical activity (PA) are associated with arterial stiffness in individuals with and without metabolic syndrome (MetS). This cross-sectional study comprised 197 individuals (47±13 years; 58% female) from a primary health care centre. Arterial stiffness was assessed using carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (cfPWV). Metabolic syndrome was determined as clustering of at least 3 out of 5 risk factors (central obesity, hypertension, impaired glucose, triglycerides and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol). Daily PA was objectively assessed and classified in Sed, light and moderate-to-vigorous PA. Physical activity was used as a continuous variable for multiple regression analysis. For mean comparisons of cfPWV between subjects with and without MetS, a binary split at the median of Sed and PA was used. Sedentary time was associated with cfPWV (?=0.11; p=0.01) explaining 1.3% of its variance; independently of age (?=0.49; p<0.001), systolic blood pressure (?=0.27; p<0.001) and fasting glucose (?=0.19; p<0.001). Participants with MetS and more Sed had higher cfPWV than those with MetS and less Sed (9.9±1.0 vs. 8.9±1.0?m/s; p<0.05). Sedentary time is associated with cfPWV independently of age and metabolic risk factors. A higher Sed in MetS individuals lead to a worse arterial stiffness profile.
