Avian arboviral surveillance is an integral part of any disease-based integrated mosquito control program. The Harris County Public Health Mosquito and Vector Control Division has performed arboviral surveillance in the wild birds of Harris County and the City of Houston since 1965. Blood samples from live trapped birds were tested for arboviral antibodies to West Nile virus (WNV), St. Louis encephalitis, Eastern equine encephalitis, and Western equine encephalitis. A dead bird surveillance program was created in 2002 with the arrival of WNV in Harris County. Since implementation, the program has detected considerable variability in viral activity with annual WNV seroprevelance rates ranging from 2.9% to 17.7%, while the percentage of positive dead birds has ranged from 0.3% to 57.2%. In 2015, 1,345 live birds were sampled and 253 dead birds were tested, with WNV incidence rates of 16.5% and 5.9%, respectively.
