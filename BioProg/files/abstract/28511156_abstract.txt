The role of enteroviruses in development of dilated cardiomyopathy, myocardial infarction, myocarditis, pericarditis is known.To examine the role of chronic enterovirus infections in development of acute stroke.Blood samples from 72 patients with acute stroke (study group) and 35 patients without vascular disease (control group) were investigated by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction for the presence of enterovirus RNA, by using virological method to detect enteroviruses, by ELISA for the levels of IgM and IgG antibodies to enteroviruses.The enteroviruses genomes were detected significantly often in the serum of patients with stroke (23,6 ± 5,9%) than in control group (2,9 ± 2,8%). The viruses were isolated and were identified as Coxsackie B (serotypes 2, 3, 4) and ECHO (serotypes 6, 9, 27 (two strains), 29), three strains have not been identified in study group. IgM to enteroviruses were not found in the sera of both groups of patients. IgG to enteroviruses were detected in 17 patients in study group (23,6 ± 5,9%) and 2 patients in control group (5,7 ± 3,9%). The presence of enteroviruses genomes and IgG in sera of patients in control group (11,1 ± 3,7%) indicate the persistence of enteroviruses. The proportion of patients with IgG to enteroviruses in sera is higher in study group (12,5 ± 3,9%) than in control group (5,7 ± 3,9%).The enterovirus infections play trigger role in development of acute stroke.
