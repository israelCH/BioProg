Two transfluthrin-based spatial repellent products (Raid Dual Action Insect Repellent and Home Freshener and Raid Shield (currently not commercially available), SC Johnson, Racine WI) were evaluated for spatial repellent effects against female Aedes aegypti (L.) mosquitoes under laboratory (wind tunnel) and semi-field (outdoor enclosure) conditions. The placement of either product in the wind tunnel significantly reduced host-seeking behaviors. The mean baseline (control) landing counts for the Raid Dual Action and Raid Shield were reduced by 95% and 74% respectively. Mean probing counts for the Raid Dual Action were reduced by 95%, while the probing counts for the Raid Shield were decreased by 69%. Baseline blood-feeding success was significantly reduced for both treatments: Raid Dual Action (100%) and Raid Shield (96%). Semi-field evaluations were conducted in outdoor enclosures at the Navy Entomology Center of Excellence, Jacksonville, Florida. A moderate reduction in mosquito entry into military style tents resulted when either product was placed near the tent opening. The Raid Shield reduced mosquito entry into tents by 88%, while the Dual Action decreased entry by 66%.
