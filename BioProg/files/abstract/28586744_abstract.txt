Atypical antipsychotics particularly olanzapine are associated with obesity and serious metabolic disturbances. As green tea (Camellia sinensis) is generally associated with beneficial effects on obesity and other metabolic disturbances, this study was undertaken to evaluate the effect of green tea aqueous extract (GTAE) on olanzapine induced weight gain and metabolic abnormalities in rats. Male Wistar rats were divided into eight groups: control, olanzapine (5mg/kg/day, IP.), GTAE (25, 50 and 100mg/kg/day, IP.) plus olanzapine and GTAE (25, 50 and 100mg/kg/day, IP.). Treatments were continued for 11 days. Body weight gain, average food and water intake were measured during the experiment. Plasma lipid, glucose and leptin levels, mean systolic blood pressure and total locomotion were evaluated at the end of experiment. Olanzapine induced significant weight gain at the end of treatment (10.38% of body weight) when compared to control (3.13% of body weight) in male Wistar rats. Average food and water intake were increased by olanzapine treatment. 11days olanzapine administration led to hyperleptinemia, hyperglycemia and dyslipidemia. Olanzapine also increased mean systolic blood pressure and decreased total locomotion. GTAE decreased significantly body weight gain and average food and water intake, improved the changes in lipid profile as well as fasting blood glucose, and finally decreased hyperleptinemia and hypertension induced by olanzapine. Results of this study demonstrated that GTAE could exert protective effects against olanzapine induced obesity partially due to its lowering effect on leptin. GTAE improved other metabolic abnormalities including dyslipidemia, hyperglycemia and hypertension induced by olanzapine in rats.
