The ability to rapidly and accurately diagnose leishmaniasis is a military priority. Testing was conducted to evaluate diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of field-expedient Leishmania genus and visceral Leishmania specific dual-fluorogenic, hydrolysis probe (TaqMan), polymerase chain reaction assays previously established for use in vector surveillance. Blood samples of patients with confirmed visceral leishmaniasis and controls without the disease from Baringo District, Kenya, were tested. Leishmania genus assay sensitivity was 100% (14/14) and specificity was 84% (16/19). Visceral Leishmania assay sensitivity was 93% (13/14) and specificity 80% (4/5). Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) skin scrapes of patients from Honduras were also evaluated. Leishmania genus assay sensitivity was 100% (10/10). Visceral Leishmania assay specificity was 100% (10/10) from cutaneous leishmaniasis samples; no fluorescence above background was reported. These results show promise in a rapid, sensitive, and specific method for Leishmania direct detection from clinical samples.
