This study was designed to investigate the toxicokinetics of Cadmium (Cd) in Chinemys reevesii. The animals were exposed to 15 mg/kg Cd chloride by intraperitoneal injection, and the Cd absorption, distribution, and excretion in different organs were determined. The results showed that Cd absorption reached its peak in the blood at 3 h after treatment. The accumulation of Cd was the highest in the liver and the second highest in the pancreas. All other tissues also accumulated Cd, such as spleen, kidney, intestine, lung, stomach, heart, brain, muscle. A small amount of Cd was found in the faeces. The urine and bile had low concentrations of Cd. In conclusion, absorbance of Cd reaches its peak at 3 h in blood. The liver and pancreas are the major organs of Cd accumulation, and the major excretion route of Cd is through feaces.
