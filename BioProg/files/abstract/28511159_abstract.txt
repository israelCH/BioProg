Obesity is strongly associated with an increased risk of developing insulin resistance as the metabolic indicator of prediabetes and a major risk factor in diabetes mellitus type 2 pathogenesis. Medicinal products obtained from apples can be used as potent prophylactic and therapeutic remedies in treatment of diabetes mellitus.Experiment was designed to study the effect of total apple polyphenol food concentrate on lipid metabolism under experimental IR.Male Wistar rats weighting 180-210 g were used in the experiment. IR was induced by high-calorie diet enriched with fructose. The effect of total apple polyphenol food concentrate was compared with the action of epigallocatechin gallate and quercetin. To estimate the alterations in lipid metabolism in liver homogenate were measured triacylglycerols, free fatty acids, total phospholipids, TBA-reactive substance and conjugated dienes contents. In blood serum were measured total lipids, triacylglycerols, cholesterol, total phospholipids and reduced glutathione levels.The obtained results indicated that feeding rats with high-calorie diet enriched with fructose caused the dyslipidemia and oxidative stress development. The administration of quercetin, epigallocatechin gallate and total apple polyphenol food concentrate improved disorders of lipid metabolism and pro-oxidant-antioxidant homeostasis.Total apple polyphenol food concentrate had a more pronounced effect on studied indices that is probably due to synergism and additive effect of extract numerous components.
