The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a prominent organelle in Sertoli cells. It is an integral component of unique adhesion junctions (ectoplasmic specializations-ESs) in this cell type, and is closely associated with structures termed tubulobulbar complexes (TBCs) that internalize intercellular junctions during sperm release and during the translocation of spermatocytes through the blood-testis barrier. A role for the ER in Ca2+ regulation at ESs and TBCs has been suspected, but evidence for this function has proved elusive. Using electron microscopy, we define two new ER-plasma membrane (PM) contact sites in apical Sertoli cell processes. One of these sites occurs at TBCs where flattened lamellar cisternae of ER envelope the swollen bulb regions of the complexes, and where the gap between adjacent membranes is 12 nm. The other is at the periphery of apical processes where the gap between membranes is 13-14 nm. Using immunolocalization at the light and electron microscopic levels, we demonstrate that Ca2+ regulatory machinery is present at the ESs attached to spermatid heads, and at ER-PM contacts. ATPA2A (SERCA2) is present at ESs, TRPM6, HOMER1, and ITPR (IP3R) are present at ER-PM contacts associated with TBC bulbs, and STIM1, ORAI1 and ATPA2A are present at the ER-PM contacts around the margins of Sertoli cell apical processes. The results support the conclusion that the molecular machinery necessary for ER generated Ca2+ fluxes is present in regions and structures directly related to junction remodeling in Sertoli cells, a process necessary for sperm release.
