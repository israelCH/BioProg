Background and Objective?Superficial temporal artery (STA)-middle cerebral artery (MCA) bypass is a procedure to reconstruct cerebral blood flow in the MCA territory. In some cases, the STA wall is thickened and the size discrepancy between STA and MCA is apparent. In such a situation, STA-MCA bypass is challenging. We present two patients who underwent STA-MCA bypass using STA in which a thickened intima was removed. We discuss the usefulness of this rescue technique. Patients and Results?A patient with an atherosclerotic MCA occlusion and another with an occluded internal carotid artery are included. Endarterectomy of STA was performed before or during anastomosis, and the intima-resected STA was anastomosed to MCA. In both cases, the STA was thick and hard, and it was difficult to anastomose the STA as it was to the MCA. Patency of the bypass was confirmed by postoperative angiography. Conclusion?Endarterectomy of a thickened STA might be an effective rescue technique in cases with severely atherosclerotic STA in STA-MCA bypass.
