Clinical studies have found that the incidence of cancer metastasis through the lymphatic vessels are 3-5 times higher than that through the blood vessels. These findings suggest the potency of anti-lymphangiogenic therapy in reducing the incidence of cancer metastasis. Previously, we reported LHbisD4, which is the conjugate of low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) and four bis-deoxycholates as a potent anti-angiogenic drug with less toxicity and orally active property. Here, we show that LHbisD4 could also suppress the formation of new lymphatic vessels and attenuate the incidence of metastasis by blocking VEGF-C signaling pathway. LHbisD4 significantly enhanced binding affinity with VEGF-C when compared with LMWH, which enables LHbisD4 to suppress the proliferation, migration and formation of tubular structures of human dermal lymphatic endothelial cells(HDLECs) in in vitro condition even in the presence of excessive amounts of VEGF-C. Similarly, we found that the density of lymphatic vessels in the primary tumor tissue in breast cancer bearing mice was significantly diminished when LHbisD4 was administered compared with the control group. Also, the incidence of axillary lymph nodes and distant organ metastasis was significantly reduced in the LHbisD4 administered group, which demonstrates that LHbisD4 could successfully lower the incidence of metastasis through blocking VEGF-C induced lymphangiogenesis. Based on these results, we propose LHbisD4 as a potent anti-cancer drug that can reduce the incidence of metastasis by suppressing lymphangiogenesis through blocking VEGF-C signaling pathway.
