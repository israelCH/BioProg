Priapism is a prolonged erection without sexual stimulation. In most cases it requires prompt management in order to avoid long-term consequences such as erectile dysfunction or penile deformity. Priapism is rare in children, but haematological diseases play an important role. The diagnosis is generally not difficult. Blood gas analysis and Doppler sonography are used to establish the form of priapism and determine its further management. The management of low-flow priapism consists of immediate blood aspiration and intracavernosal injection of sympathomimetic drugs as needed. In case of treatment failure, a shunt is also necessary. High-flow priapism generally does not require any immediate treatment. X-ray-assisted selective embolisation in case of fistula is associated with a high success rate. The primary aim in stuttering priapism is reduction and prophylaxis of erections and patient education about the disease. Penile prostheses are not used in children.
