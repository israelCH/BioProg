Epidemics caused by the re-emergence of Zika virus (ZIKAV) warrant the need to develop new diagnostic measures to complement currently used detection methods. In this study, we explored the detection of ZIKAV antigen in a defined leucocyte subset from patient's whole blood.Whole blood samples were obtained at the acute and early convalescent phase from ZIKAV-infected patients during the Singapore outbreak in Aug-Sep 2016. Presence of ZIKAV antigen was determined by flow cytometry staining for intracellular ZIKAV NS3 with a ZIKAV-specific polyclonal antibody. The presence of ZIKAV antigen was determined in CD45 + CD14+ monocytes.Data showed that ZIKAV NS3 antigen could be detected and the levels of detection were further categorized into 3 groups-high (>40% positive), moderate (between 10-40% positive) and low (<10% positive). While majority of patients showed a decrease in the amount of ZIKAV antigen detected at later time points, some patients displayed higher levels as the disease progressed.Our data highlights an alternative approach in using flow cytometry for the sensitive detection of ZIKAV antigen in whole blood. Importantly, it further confirms the role of CD14+ monocytes as an important cellular target for ZIKAV infection during the viremic phase.
