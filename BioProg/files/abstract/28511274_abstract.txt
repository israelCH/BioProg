Between 5 and 8 million people globally are infected with Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative parasitic agent of Chagas disease. The vast majority of incident infections originate in pockets of Latin America where domestic vector-borne transmission cycles are more common. Since 1955, when the first locally-acquired case was reported, fewer than 30 autochthonous cases have been documented in the United States. We describe the case of an 18-year-old US Air Force trainee, a native Texan with no travel history beyond the continental United States, who screened positive for T cruzi infection on blood donation and was subsequently found to have chronic Chagasic cardiomyopathy. This is the first documented case of Chagas disease in a US military trainee and one of the first known autochthonous cases of Chagasic cardiomyopathy in a Texas resident. Diagnostic, therapeutic, and military implications are discussed.
