We proposed a mathematical model and estimated the parameters of adsorption of albumin-bilirubin complex to the surface of carbon pyropolymer. Design data corresponded to the results of experimental studies. Our findings indicate that modeling of this process should take into account fractal properties of the surface of carbon pyropolymer.
